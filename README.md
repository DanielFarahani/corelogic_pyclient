# Corelogic API Python client

## Overview

This is a Python client for the [CoreLogic API](https://developer.corelogic.asia/apis/docs/overview-au).

I haven't seen any clients for Python, so this is a start.

Basic usage is can be accessed through Client.py where default parameters are given to for subquries.
For detailed usage individual end points can be called directly.
